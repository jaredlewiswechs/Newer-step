# Notes App (TinyTalk)
# Opens a small Notes window and exposes save/load via shell API

shell.open_window("Notes")
# This script runs once to create a window and register shell APIs.
# The app uses `shell.save_note(title, content)` and `shell.load_note(entry_id)`
# via the shell/client UI to persist and retrieve notes.
